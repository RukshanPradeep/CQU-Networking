In the COIT20246 project, our group consisted of two students: Manavi and Shihan. We collaborated effectively to meet the project requirements. Here's a reflection on how we worked together, what worked well, and the issues we encountered, along with recommended techniques for future group projects:

### Collaboration Approach:

-	Task Split: We divided the tasks based on our strengths and interests. Manavi focused on network design, while Shihan concentrated on cloud service cost estimation and security controls. We collaborated on the overall project and reviewed each other's work.

-	Communication: We maintained regular communication through messaging apps (WhatsApp) and emails to discuss project-related matters, share progress updates, and clarify doubts.

## Positives and Negatives of Group Work

 ### What Worked Well:

-	Task Division: Dividing the project into distinct tasks based on our expertise allowed us to work efficiently and make progress simultaneously.

-	Clear Communication: Open and frequent communication helped in resolving doubts promptly and ensuring we were on the same page throughout the project.

-	Peer Review: Reviewing each other's work provided valuable feedback, helping us identify areas for improvement and ensuring the quality of our project.

### Issues Encountered:

-	Scheduling Conflicts: At times, coordinating our schedules for meetings and discussions was challenging due to conflicting commitments.
-	Resource Availability: Access to certain resources, such as specific software or documentation, was limited, affecting our ability to complete tasks promptly.


## Recommended Techniques for Group Work in Future

-	Project Management Tools: Using project management tools like Trello or Asana can help in scheduling tasks, setting deadlines, and tracking progress. This would address scheduling conflicts by providing a clear timeline for tasks.

-	Shared Resources: Ensure that all team members have access to necessary resources and software, either through university resources or cloud-based collaboration tools.

-	Regular Check-Ins: Schedule regular check-in meetings to discuss progress, address issues, and share updates. This can help in maintaining clear communication and resolving conflicts.

-	Task Allocation: Assign tasks based on individual strengths and interests to maximize efficiency and motivation.

-	Peer Review: Continue the practice of peer reviewing each other's work, as it enhances the quality of the project and encourages collaborative learning.
